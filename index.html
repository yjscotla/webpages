   <p>Hello! My name is Yasmine Scotland,<br>I am a freshman at NCSU and a sophomore at Meredith College.<br>
    I am majoring in <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> and I am also majoring in <ins>Mathematics</ins> at
   Meredith College.<br>I am enrolled in their Dual Degree program. I choose to major in engineering because of my brother,
   who's a electrical engineer. His motivation and passion to become an engineer led me to my dream major.</p> <br>

    <p> At the moment I am working a retail job back home where I live. I am a seasonal worker, which means when I am 
    back home from summer, winter, or Christmas break, I have a job to come back to. <br>Due to my major being so
    broad, I have no decided exactly what I want to do with it when I graduate. That being said, I don't have
    a "dream job" there are companies that I am very interested in working at. For example, working at BMW is a 
    dream of mine, and I would love to be part of working there.<br> </p><hr>
